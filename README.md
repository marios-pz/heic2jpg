# heic2jpg
**heic2jpg** is a lightweight and efficient script for converting `.heic` 
and `.HEIC` image files to `.jpg` format. It uses parallel processing to speed up the conversion process,
making it ideal for handling large directories of HEIC images. After each successful conversion, the original `.heic` file is safely deleted.

## Features
- **Automatic cleanup**: Deletes `.heic` files after successful conversion to `.jpg`.
- **Recursive directory search**: Converts all `.heic` files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
- **Error handling**: If the conversion fails, the original `.heic` file is retained.
